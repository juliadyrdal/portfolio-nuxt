# **Fjordtours B2B Portal Redesign: Rethinking Workflows**

## **Project Overview**
**Title:** Rethinking Workflows  
**Client:** Fjordtours  
**Objective:** Redesign a B2B booking portal to improve efficiency and usability, supporting Fjordtours’ strategic focus on B2B sales.

---

## **Needs and Constraints**
### **Scoping the Project**
Fjordtours scheduled the B2B portal redesign as a multi-stage release:
1. **MVP Release:** Enable agents to view transport orders and process card payments, aiming to reduce the internal booking team’s workload.
2. **Second Release:** Add functionality for agents to modify existing orders and include additional payment options.
3. **Third Release:** Allow agents to book transport products directly.

With limited time before the MVP release, collaboration with the frontend team was essential to integrate UX enhancements while aligning with ongoing development.

### **Future Scalability**
Though the initial focus was on transport orders, the UX design needed to account for future product categories, ensuring that the interface could scale smoothly in features and functionality.

---

## **Client Background**
Fjordtours is a leading inbound tour operator in Norway, known for its signature “In a Nutshell” tours that combine transport and local experiences, such as cider tasting and kayaking. Fjordtours aims to strengthen its B2B sales channel, allowing agents to book directly, bypassing intermediaries and enhancing customer reach.

### **Catalysts for Change**
- **Increased B2B Focus:** B2B sales offer higher margins and reach agents with limited local expertise, making Fjordtours an attractive service partner.
- **Exclusive Ticketing:** As the sole advance seller of VY train tickets, Fjordtours needed a system to handle group bookings efficiently.
- **Industry Challenges:** High turnover in the travel sector due to the pandemic led to more inexperienced agents needing user-friendly tools.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Fjordtours’ B2B platform was originally designed for internal use, resulting in an interface that is not intuitive for external agents. A confusing and ineffective interface risks alienating users and undermining Fjordtours’ strategic goals.

> **Problem:** “How can we create a conceptual model that aligns with diverse user needs, supporting agents’ workflows and reducing friction in task completion?”

---

## **Research and Discovery**
### **Research Plan and Objectives**
To design a solution that fits seamlessly into users' workflows, we explored:
- **Ecosystem Understanding:** Identifying key roles, products, and business processes to contextualize the B2B portal.
- **User and Business Insights:** Mapping Fjordtours’ strategic goals and business logic alongside agents’ mental models and workflow pain points.

### **Research Methods**
- **Secondary Research:** Literature review and competitive analysis to understand the market and existing solutions.
- **Primary Research:**
  - **Interviews** with stakeholders and industry experts to understand the ecosystem and user challenges.
  - **Contextual Inquiry** with agents to observe real-world workflows, needs, and pain points.

---

## **Summary of Findings**
Key insights shaped the solution:
1. **Efficiency is Crucial:** Agents need tools that integrate smoothly with their larger workflow.
2. **Mismatch in Mental Models:** The current interface does not align with users’ workflows, creating unnecessary friction.
3. **Diverse User Needs:** Different agents have varied requirements based on their expertise and location within the value chain.

---

## **Ideation and Solution**
### **Command and Control Center**
The redesigned portal leverages familiar search, predictive search, and command palette patterns to improve usability:
- **Centralized Search Box:** Allows agents to confirm orders, check product availability, and manage support tickets from a single interface.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Offers complexity gradually, supporting both novice and expert users.

### **Conceptual and Mental Model Alignment**
Creating a conceptual model that mirrors agents' mental models reduces cognitive load, making the interface more intuitive:
- **Consistent Terminology:** The platform’s terminology matches agents’ vocabulary, minimizing confusion and enhancing usability.
- **Clear Object Hierarchy:** Key objects (e.g., products, orders, destinations, support tickets) are consistently defined, with clear actions and attributes, like order reference numbers, improving predictability.

---

## **Key Task Flows**
The solution was built around primary tasks identified during research:
1. Book a train journey for a large group.
2. Book a Norway in a Nutshell roundtrip.
3. View order by reference.
4. Open and view customer support tickets.
5. Check payment status.

---

## **Design Patterns**
### **Search and Command Palette**
- **Command Palette:** Shortcuts support quick actions for expert users.
- **Predictive Search:** Search suggestions appear as the user types, organized by object types to enhance scanability and efficiency.
- **Contextual Quick Actions:** Contextual shortcuts reduce clicks and improve flow, catering to both novice and expert users.

### **Design Principles**
The interface incorporates cognitive psychology principles to enhance usability:
- **Reduce Cognitive Load:** By keeping search terms and actions visible, users can make decisions without overloading their memory.
- **Contextual Cues for Novices:** Novice users receive guidance through hover cues, while experts can use shortcuts for faster task completion.

---

## **Wireflows**
The visual hierarchy reflects the user’s mental model:
1. **Order-Level Information:** Displays high-level details and actions for the entire order.
2. **Order-Item Information:** Sub-orders are shown as individual components (inspired by itinerary layouts), making it easy to scan and understand.

---

## **Usability Testing**
To refine the design, usability testing focused on:
- **Matching User Mental Models:** Validating that the conceptual model aligns with users' expectations.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Measuring task completion speed and identifying usability pain points.
- **Test Tasks:** Booking a trip, managing orders, and checking payment status, to validate key flows and benchmark future iterations.

---

## **Design Requirements**
Using the Requirements Definition Process, we separated the *what* from the *how* to prevent stakeholders from designing solutions. This approach ensured that the final product focused on real user needs rather than replicating the current system’s limitations.

---

## **Imagining a Better Story**
### **Context Scenario**
A narrative-based scenario helped align stakeholders and visualize user journeys, setting the stage for an intuitive and efficient user experience.

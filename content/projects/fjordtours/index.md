Project overview

Created a new workflow for Fjord Tour's B2B booking system. Fjord Tours is the travel package provider behind products such as Norway's best selling roundtrip, 'Norway in a Nutshell'.

Role
::

::SectionCopy
#text
I worked as an integral part of the frontend team at Fjord Tours, participating in daily stand ups and weekly sprint planning meetings. Day to day I worked closely with the frontend developers, but I also worked independently with external graphic designers, to align my work with new design guidelines that were being developed at the time.

Fjord Tours
::

::SectionCopy
#text
Fjordtours is an inbound tour operator based in Bergen, Norway. They aim to give travellers the quintessential local experience, conceptualised through their branded ‘In a Nutshell Tours’, offered both to travel agents and direct to consumers. In a Nutshell Tours combines transport, such as ferries and trains, with local activities en route, including apple cider tasting and kayaking in UNESCO listed landscape. Fjordtours’ flagship product, ‘Norway in a Nutshell’ which includes the spectacular Flåm railway journey, is Norways most popular roundtrip.

The client's problem
::

::SectionCopy
#text
As B2B sales have not been a prioritised channel for Fjordtours in past, the booking platform used by agents to place orders reflects this. The current interface was developed for use by Fjordtours’ internal booking team, and is characterised by creative work-araounds. The platform was designed from a backend perspective, with little to no user and stakeholder involvement, which has left it unintuitive to use for both agents and Fjordtours employees.

As reaching non-specialist tour operators is a strategic aim, the poor and confusing interface poses a risk to the implementation of business goals. As Fjordtours’ head of B2B sales puts it “if these agents do not understand the interface, they will simply leave”. Even for agents who book through the interface regularly, it provokes negative emotions to the extent that they dread having to book Norway in a Nutshell, and have made point of sale agents advice travellers to book directly from the consumer facing website.

Finally, as Fjordtours only recently started selling group transport for VY, there currently is no solution for agents to book ‘transport only’ products, and they instead rely on e-mail communications with the internal booking team. The booking team, already overburdened with compensating for the lack of usability of the B2B platform, is now at maximum capacity, leaving little room for the strategic allocation of resources.

So how might we solve it?
::

::SectionCopy
#text
- **How might we** make it fast and easy for expert users to complete tasks in the interface, without confusing novice users?
- **How might we** create a tool that fits into and supports users’ over all workflow?
- **How might we** make the learning curve fast without compromising on efficiency?

A Command and Control Centre
::

::SectionCopy
#text
A command and control centre, inspired by rich search, predictive search and command palettes, will give expert users the speed, efficiency and flexibility they need. This solution is still easy to use for novice users, due to progressive reveal, combined with the use of concepts which are already familiar to them. From the search box, users can confirm order details, check the availability of products (and continue to booking), discover products by destination, and view and open new customer support tickets.

Command palette with context cues

#text
The search box is partly a command palette, as the user can execute short cut commands when the element is in focus. Another feature inspired by command palettes is that the suggested options (results) depend on specific formatting. As an example, if the user begins the input with a hash symbol, the system “knows” that the user is referring to a specific order, and displays the appropriate actions to be performed on that order.

Rich search results
::

::SectionImageCopy
#image
![Fjord Tours command pallette](/images/projects/fjordtours3.png)
#text
Search results/suggested options are grouped into descriptive categories, which lets the user immediately scan and navigate to the appropriate option. The group patterns are consistent, which makes using the search box predictable, and in turn becoming automatic.

Predictive search
::

::SectionImageCopy
#image
![Fjord Tours command pallette](/images/projects/fjordtours4.png)
#text
The search box gives the user suggestions based on their input as they type. The suggestions are based on the designs conceptual model, making the functionality intuitive, but also making it easier to provide useful predictions. As an example, if a user searches for a particular destination, the suggestions will display all the objects that have the destination as an attribute, grouped by object type.

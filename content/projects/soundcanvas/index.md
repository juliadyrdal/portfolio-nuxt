SoundCanvas is a web application targeted at musicians. Users of the web app can create their own 1-page website to promote themselves and their music through tailored content such as Spotify embeds. Users start with an empty canvas and then add individual sections, from a list of sections grouped by role. After adding a section, the content and design can be edited.

Technical description
::

::SectionCopy
#text
This web app is built with Vue.js 3 with composition API and Nuxt for SSR. I used scoped CSS with no pre processor or utility library, mostly to maintain pure css skills. Pinia was used for state management, both for UI elements like modals, and to track sections added to the website.

Technical challenges

Letting users edit the sections posed some technical challenges, such as lining up input fields with the elements showing the ouputs. Another technical challenge was how to actually render the 1-page websites so that the target group could actually use them.

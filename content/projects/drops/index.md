Drops is a UX project where the aim is to influence the users of an app to conserve water, and also to raise awareness around the human and environmental cost of water consumption.

Defining the problem
::

::SectionCopy
#text
After literary and user research, the problem was narrowed down and defined.
::

::SectionSubheading
#text
Primary problem statement
::

::SectionCopy
#text
Users strongly believe that there are no reasons to conserve water in Norway, due to the apparent abundance of water, the low cost and flat-rate pricing model, and the hidden nature of the service and infrastructure. This leads users to waste water through uncritical consumption, causing unnecessary pollution and carbon emissions.
::

#text
Secondary problem statement
::

::SectionCopy
#text
Users believe that their consumer choices make a difference, and wish to consume in an ethical and environmental way, without sacrifising too many convenience aspects. Despite their goals, users inadvertently contribute to water access inequality and scarcity in critical areas, because they hold the belief that they have no influence on global water issues.

Vision statement
::

::SectionCopy
#text
The design solution will give users a sense of their relative and volumetric water consumption, both directly and indirectly (consumer goods), equipping them to adjust against a target or benchmark, while at the same time incentivising users to to conserve directly, and raising usersâ€™ awareness about water intesive consumer goods.

How might we?
::

::SectionCopy
#text
- How might we help users understand how much water they are consuming?
- How might we incentivise users to conserve water?
- How might we equip users with the tools to make better consumer choices, in terms of the global water crisis, in a way that is convenient to them?

Solution
::

::SectionCopy
#text
The app connects to the user's municipality's smart water meter system, providing real-time insights into the user's accumulated water consumption through an interactive graph. It delivers personalized insights and facts about water usage, helping the user to understand and optimize their habits. With features to set water-saving goals, the app rewards efforts with potential awards and a reduced water bill, making conservation both impactful and rewarding.
